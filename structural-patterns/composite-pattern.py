# The goal of the Composite Design Pattern is to treat individual components (single classes or scalars) and
# group of objects (aggregates of components) in an uniform fashion.
# It is used to treat both individual Classes (scalars) and Compound Classes (or Inheritance based
# Class Hierarchies) in the same way.

# One object uses the properties/members of another object through either Inheritance or Composition.
# Composition lets us make "Compound objects" such as a mathematical expression composed of simple
# expressions; or a grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes.

# In the Composite pattern, an object of class 'Foo' and a object of class 'Sequence' (that yields several
# instances of the class 'Foo') have common API. Some Composed and Singular objects need similar/identical
# behaviours (Treat a Group of objects (Collection) using the exactly same Interface of a Single object 
# (Singular/Scalar)).

# The composite pattern uses recursive data structures to treat single objects and groups of objects
# as the same entity (uniform treatment in both cases).

# Python supports Iteration (for Composites/Collections) with the '__iter__()' method and the 'Iterable'
# abstract class (built-in abstract base class) from the 'collections.abc' package. 
# (from collections.abc import Iterable) This 'Iterable' abstract base class can be used as a guide 
# to specifically require the implementation of the '__iter__()' method.
# A Single object (Scalar) can make itself iterable (or masquerade as a Collection) by 
# yielding 'self' from its '__iter__()' method

# A COLLECTION CLASS CAN ACT AS AN INDIVIDUAL CLASS (SCALAR)


# As an example, think of a drawing app where you can group several geometric shapes together and then drag
# and drop the group like a single shape.

# The recursive Composite component can contain multiple instances of itself as well. So a 'GraphicObject'
# instance can also contain multiple other 'GraphicObject' instances as its individual shape elements

    # Properties represent an intermediate functionality between a plain attribute (or field) and a method.

    # With properties, you can change how you compute the target attribute whenever you need to do so.
    # The underlying method will allow you to modify their internal implementation and perform actions on
    # them right before your users access and mutate them.
    # The main advantage of Python properties is that they allow you to expose your attributes as part of your
    # public API. If you ever need to change the underlying implementation, then you can turn the attribute into
    # a property at any time without much pain.

    # Pythonâ€™s property() is the Pythonic way to avoid formal getter and setter methods in your code.
    # This function allows you to turn class attributes into properties or managed attributes.
    # Since property() is a built-in function, you can use it without importing anything. Additionally,
    # property() was implemented in C to ensure optimal performance.

    # The @property decorator must decorate the getter method.
    # The docstring must go in the getter method

# EXERCISE 

# Consider the code presented below. We have two classes called 'SingleValue' and 'ManyValues'. 'SingleValue' 
# stores just one numeric value, but 'ManyValues' can store either numeric values or 'SingleValue' objects.
# You are asked to give both 'SingleValue' and 'ManyValues' a property member called 'sum' that returns a sum of 
# all the values that the object contains. Please ensure that there is only a single method that realizes the 
# property 'sum', not multiple methods.

# Here is a sample unit test:

# import unittest
# class FirstTestSuite(unittest.TestCase):
#     def test(self):
#         single_value = SingleValue(11)
#         other_values = ManyValues()
#         other_values.append(22)
#         other_values.append(33)
        # make a list of all values
        # all_values = ManyValues()
        # all_values.append(single_value)
        # all_values.append(other_values)
        # self.assertEqual(all_values.sum, 66)
